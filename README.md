## Reflex

Reflex is an Interactive Music System that was closely modelled after Stafford Beer's Viable System Model - a holistic model for the organization of increasingly complex systems. Using a number of Digital Signal Processing solutions, an external audio source can be used as a trigger and audio input to create textured sounds, syncopated rhythms and expanded counterpoint. The system can be used for sound design or as an interactive partner for improvisation.

The project was developed as part of my MSc in Sound Design at the University of Edinburgh. For further information about the project, the included DSP modules etc. have a look at the pdf file.

## Dependencies

You will need to download the FluCoMa Toolkit from the Max Package Manager for some of the Audio Descriptors and the Audio Classifier
